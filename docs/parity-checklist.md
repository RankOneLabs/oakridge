# Operator PWA parity evidence

The comparison source is `main` at the start of the c10 parity gate. Each entry
below quotes an assertion from that source and the corresponding assertion in
this branch. **Translated** means the same operator behavior is checked through
the generated read model. **Relaxed** means coverage is weaker. **Unportable**
means the old behavior has no equivalent contract or surface in this branch;
the original assertion is retained here for review rather than silently
deleted. A passing test does not resolve an unportable entry.

## `kbbl/core/pwa/oakridge/__tests__/artifact-review.test.tsx`

| Classification | Original assertion (`main`) | New assertion | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Translated | `expect(screen.getByTestId("or-artifact-type").textContent).toBe("spec_v2");` | `expect(screen.getByTestId("or-artifact-review").textContent).toContain("analysis");` | The generated projection identifies the output by `output_key`; `type_id` is not in the current artifact revision contract. The same review heading identifies the artifact being read. |
| Unportable | `expect(screen.getByTestId("or-artifact-stage").textContent).toBe("spec");` | No equivalent assertion. | The output slot and revision do not carry a producing stage; the scope has a key and label, but asserting either would claim a different fact. |
| Translated | `expect(body.textContent).toContain("Spec body");` | `expect(screen.getByTestId("operator-typed-value").textContent).toContain("Spec body");` | The revision body is a generated `OperatorCheckedValue` rendered by the typed viewer. |
| Unportable | `expect(validation.textContent).toContain("true");` | No equivalent assertion. | Validation metadata is absent from `OperatorArtifactRevisionRecord`; validation belongs to the authority before publication. |
| Unportable | `expect(status.textContent).toBe("approved");` | No equivalent assertion. | Current revision records do not have an `approved` status field. |
| Unportable | `expect(screen.getByTestId("or-artifact-detail").getAttribute("data-review-layout")).toBe("report");` | No equivalent assertion. | Review descriptors and their layout field are not projected. The viewer is selected from the checked body schema. |
| Unportable | `expect(screen.getByTestId("or-decision-approve").textContent).toContain("Approve discrepancy report");` | No equivalent assertion. | Action labels are now the pinned command label, not an artifact-local override. |
| Unportable | `expect(sections.map((section) => section.getAttribute("data-artifact-section"))).toEqual(["summary", "details"]);` | No equivalent assertion. | Descriptor sections are absent; checked schemas determine field order. |
| Translated | `expect(await screen.findByTestId("or-artifact-gate-actions")).toBeTruthy();` | `expect(screen.getByTestId("or-gate-actions").textContent).toContain("Submit Approve");` | The current action is a command on the scope, whose observed target identifies the revision. |
| Translated | `expect(screen.queryByTestId("or-artifact-gate-actions")).toBeNull();` | `expect(screen.queryByTestId("or-gate-actions")).toBeNull();` | Switching to a revision outside the observed command target still hides the action. |
| Unportable | `expect(fetchSpy.mock.calls.some(([input]) => String(input).includes("/runs/run-1/gates"))).toBe(true);` | No equivalent assertion. | Current scope projections include commands and targets; there is no run-scoped gate fetch. |
| Unportable | `expect(await screen.findByText("Scope")).toBeTruthy(); expect(screen.getByText("migration")).toBeTruthy(); expect(screen.queryByTestId("or-plan-cohorts")).toBeNull();` | No equivalent assertion in this file. | The old fixture is an untyped plan body and descriptor. A checked `plan_body` and schema must drive the current `PlanViewer`; its coverage belongs to the viewer suite. |
| Translated | `expect(await screen.findByTestId("or-artifact-detail-error")).toBeTruthy();` | `expect(screen.getByRole("status").textContent).toContain("unavailable in the current scope projection");` | The current review consumes the already loaded scope projection and exposes an explicit missing-revision state. Fetch failure remains the responsibility of the scope loader. |
| Translated | `expect(screen.queryByText("← Back")).toBeNull();` | `expect(screen.getByRole("button", { name: "← Overview" })).toBeTruthy();` | Review navigation is now an explicit overview action on the review shell. This is a changed interaction, so the old absence assertion cannot be preserved literally. |

The first suite has 4 passing tests. The unportable assertions above remain
open parity decisions.

## `kbbl/core/pwa/oakridge/lib/run-attention.test.ts`

| Classification | Original assertion (`main`) | New assertion | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Translated | `expect([...counts]).toEqual([["run-a", 2], ["run-b", 1]]);` | `expect([...counts]).toEqual([["run-a", 2], ["run-b", 1]]);` | Inputs now come from the generated inbox command variant through `makeInboxCommand`; the run grouping claim is identical. |
| Translated | `expect(counts.get("run-a")).toBeUndefined();` | `expect(counts.get("run-a")).toBeUndefined();` | A generated `wait` item with reason `handoff_downstream` replaces the former blocked review item. The selector was corrected to exclude waits. |
| Translated | `expect(counts.get("run-a")).toBe(1);` | `expect(counts.get("run-a")).toBe(1);` | The generated `diagnostic` variant replaces the former `pull_request_mismatch` item; both require operator attention. |
| Unportable | `expect([cohorts.get(selectReviewCohortKey(gate)), cohorts.get(selectReviewCohortKey(admission))]).toEqual(["gate stage", "admission stage"]);` | No equivalent assertion. | The generated inbox does not project `stage_instance_id`, `unit_id`, or the former review cohort key; scope IDs replace those identities. |

## `kbbl/core/pwa/oakridge/lib/decision-queue.test.ts`

| Classification | Original assertion (`main`) | New assertion | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Unportable | `expect(selectStableDecisionQueue([live("a"), live("b"), live("c")], [gate("b"), gate("c")])).toEqual([{ kind: "settled", item: gate("a") }, live("b"), live("c")]);` | No equivalent assertion. | The generated inbox has no stable settled-row model; the current queue derives live commands from scopes. This loss of row position coverage remains open. |
| Unportable | `expect(selectStableDecisionQueue([live("a"), live("b")], [gate("assessment"), gate("a"), gate("b")])).toEqual([live("a"), live("b"), live("assessment")]);` | No equivalent assertion. | The current selector does not retain previous rows between projections. |
| Translated | `expect(selectStableDecisionQueue([], [gate("b"), gate("a")])).toEqual([live("b"), live("a")]);` | `expect(selectActionableScopes(scopes).map((scope) => scope.scope_id)).toEqual(["first", "last"]);` | Initial display order still follows the projection order; idle scopes are omitted. |

## `kbbl/core/pwa/oakridge/lib/status-tone.test.ts`

| Classification | Original assertion (`main`) | New assertion | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Translated | `expect(selectStatusTone(status as StatusToneSource)).toBe(tone);` | `for (const [status, tone] of cases) expect(selectStatusTone(status)).toBe(tone);` | The former hand-written status unions are gone. The new table retains every distinct old status and expected tone, including `pending`, `cancelled`, and `closed`; the selector was updated to preserve those colors. |
| Translated | `expect(selectStatusTone("superseded" as StatusToneSource)).toBe("muted");` | `expect(selectStatusTone("superseded")).toBe("muted");` | The generated selector accepts strings; unknown statuses still display muted. |

## `kbbl/core/pwa/oakridge/client.failure-detail.test.ts`

No changed assertions. All four tests retain their original text; `client.ts`
still re-exports `selectFailureDetail` from its current implementation module.
The test inputs are HTTP failure payloads, not hand-written read-model fixtures.

## `kbbl/core/pwa/oakridge/styling-criteria.test.ts`

No changed assertions. All four source-scanning tests retain their original
text. This suite has no read-model fixture.

## `kbbl/core/pwa/oakridge/client.project-update.test.ts`

| Classification | Original assertion (`main`) | New assertion | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Translated | `expect(result).toEqual({ ok: true, value: expect.objectContaining({ id: projectId, repo_dir: "/code/rol/scout" }) });` | `expect(await updateOperatorProject(project.id, makeProjectDraft())).toEqual(project);` | The generated `OperatorProjectView` fixture comes from `makeProject`; current client calls return the value directly. Equality checks more projected fields than the old partial match. |
| Translated | `expect(result).toEqual({ ok: false, error: { operation: "update project", path: \`/projects/${projectId}\`, detail: "repository not found" } });` | `await expect(updateOperatorProject("project-1", makeProjectDraft())).rejects.toEqual(new OakridgeHttpError(400, "repository not found"));` | HTTP failures now throw `OakridgeHttpError`. The detail is preserved; the old operation/path object is not part of the current client contract. |
| **Relaxed** | `expect(result).toEqual({ ok: false, error: { operation: "update project", path: \`/projects/${projectId}\`, detail: expect.any(String) } });` | `await expect(updateOperatorProject("project-1", makeProjectDraft())).rejects.toBeInstanceOf(SyntaxError);` | The current `request` helper lets malformed successful JSON reject without operation/path context. The test detects failure but no longer proves contextual error reporting. |

## `kbbl/core/pwa/oakridge/lib/plan-graph.test.ts`

| Classification | Original assertion (`main`) | New assertion | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Translated | `expect(layout.edges.map((edge) => \`${edge.from}->${edge.to}\`)).toEqual(["core->api", "core->ui", "api->ui"]);` | Same assertion. | The generated `plan_body` fixture uses the checked value and schema field order from the shipped development bundle. |
| Translated | `expect(top("core") < top("api") && top("api") < top("ui")).toBe(true);` | `expect(left("core") < left("api") && left("api") < left("ui")).toBe(true);` | The restored graph is horizontal; the same dependency ordering is asserted on its x axis. |
| Translated | `expect(isInside).toBe(true);` with `PLAN_GRAPH_NODE.width` and `.height` | `expect(isInside).toBe(true);` with the rendered SVG rectangle's `180` by `70` dimensions | The old layout constant is gone; the canvas containment check uses the current node dimensions. |
| Translated | `expect([orphan.nodes.length, orphan.edges.length]).toEqual([1, 0]);` | `expect([graph.nodes.length, graph.edges.length]).toEqual([1, 0]);` | An unknown dependency still creates no edge. |

## `kbbl/core/pwa/oakridge/components/molecules/PlanViewer.test.tsx`

| Classification | Original assertion (`main`) | New assertion | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Translated | `expect(screen.getAllByTestId("or-plan-graph-node")).toHaveLength(2);` | Same assertion. | The fixture is now a generated checked plan value with its schema. |
| Translated | `expect(screen.getAllByTestId("or-plan-cohort").map((card) => card.getAttribute("data-cohort-id"))).toEqual(["core", "api"]);` | `expect(screen.getAllByTestId("or-plan-cohort").map((card) => card.querySelector("strong")?.textContent)).toEqual(["core: Core", "api: API"]);` | Cards no longer expose `data-cohort-id`; the visible ID and title retain the same order, restored through `dependency_order`. |
| Translated | `expect(selectedCardId()).toBe("api");` | `expect(screen.getAllByTestId("or-plan-cohort")[1]?.getAttribute("aria-current")).toBe("true");` | The selected card is now identified by `aria-current` rather than a ring class. |
| Unportable | `expect(selectedCardId()).toBe("core");` after clicking the dependency's `After` chip | No equivalent assertion. | The current card renders `After core` as text, without a dependency navigation control. |
| Unportable | `expect(within(card).getByText("src/core.ts")).toBeTruthy();` after clicking `Details` | No equivalent assertion. | Cohort details are always displayed and the current card has no fold control. |
| Unportable | `expect(within(screen.getByTestId("or-risk-card")).getByText("No mitigation given.")).toBeTruthy();` | No equivalent assertion. | The shipped checked `risk` schema requires a mitigation string; a bare-string risk cannot be projected. |
| Unportable | `expect(screen.getByRole("alert").textContent).toContain("scope: expected an object");` | No equivalent assertion. | The checked value has already been validated by the compiler; the viewer has no untyped-body contract error surface. |
